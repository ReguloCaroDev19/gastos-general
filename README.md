# Setting Up

**Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:**

> Copy code

> `git clone https://github.com/ReguloCaroDev19/prueba-disrupcion.git`

**Open two terminals and Navigate to the project directory:**


>Copy code

> `cd test-disrupcion`

> `cd json-server`

**Install project dependencies using Yarn in both projects:**


> Copy code

> `yarn install`

**Compiling the Application**

To compile my application, run:

>Copy code

> `yarn build`

This command will build the **production-ready** version of the application and create the necessary files in the output directory (usually named build or dist).

  

**Running the Application**

To run the application in development mode (with hot-reloading), use:

>Copy code

> `yarn start`

The above command will start the development server, and you can access my application at http://localhost:3000.

  

To run the production build of my application locally, use:

>Copy code

> `yarn serve`

This command serves the production build and can be used for testing how the application performs in a production-like environment.

  

Additional Command

To run tests, use:

>Copy code

> `yarn test`

If you encounter issues or want to start fresh, you can clean the project and reinstall the dependencies:

>Copy code

> `yarn clean`

> `yarn install`

This will remove the generated build files and node_modules directory before reinstalling the dependencies.
